# Countdown

Countdown is a game consisting of 15 rounds. The highest scoring player(s) score points at the end of each round, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Rounds

Rounds are played for a maximum duration of 30 seconds each. A clock is displayed to players during rounds, showing elapsed/remaining time.

Players take turns dictating the setup of each round, with the exception of the Countdown Conundrum.

There are 3 round types:

- Letters
- Numbers
- Countdown Conundrum

These rounds are played in the following order:

1. Letters
2. Letters
3. Numbers
4. Letters
5. Letters
6. Numbers
7. Letters
8. Letters
9. Numbers
10. Letters
11. Letters
12. Numbers
13. Letters
14. Letters
15. Countdown Conundrum

### Letters

In the Letters round, players compete to find the longest word possible, using only a set of 9 letters.

#### Setup

Before the round begins, 9 letters must be selected to play with.

The letters will be selected from the top of a randomly shuffled pile. The frequency of letters contained within the piles is relative to the frequency of their occurrence in the English language.

There are two piles of letters; one containing consonants and the other containing vowels. The active player can choose which pile each of the 9 letters is picked from.

As each letter is picked, it is displayed to all players. All 9 letters will be displayed to all players for the duration of the round when setup is complete.

#### Gameplay

Once setup is complete, players are given 30 seconds to find dictionary words using some or all of the available 9 letters. Players should write their words down on paper.

Each letter can only be used once for each time it appears in the set of available letters.

When the 30 seconds are up, players must put down their pens and announce the length of the longest word they have found. Each player must then disclose their longest word.

If a player does not have their word written down, they must present their word before the other players.

If a player gives the same word as a previous player, they must prove that they did not copy the previous player by presenting their paper, where the word had been written down during the allotted 30 seconds.

If a player presents a word which is not in the Oxford English Dictionary, their word is deemed invalid, and they are unable to score points for the round.

Only **one** word can be presented by each player in a single round. If a player's word is deemed invalid, they **cannot** substitute another word.

#### Scoring

Only the player with the longest word scores points.

If there is a tie for the longest word among multiple players, they all score points.

There are no points for invalid words.

- **1 point** is awarded for each letter in the longest word(s).
- If the longest word is 9 letters long, the player is awarded **double points**.

For example:

- *TABLETS* is worth 7 points.
- *GENERATOR* is worth 18 points.

### Numbers

In the numbers round, players compete to get as close as possible to a target number, using addition, subtraction, multiplication and/or division operations on a set of 6 numbers.

#### Setup

Before the round begins, 6 numbers must be selected to play with, and a 3-digit target number must be generated.

The active player can choose the ratio of small and large numbers to appear within the set, up to a maximum of 4 large numbers. The player does not **have** to include any large numbers in the set.

Large numbers will be randomly selected from a set of 4 numbers. The 4 numbers are *25*, *50*, *75* and *100*. If the player chooses to include 4 large numbers, all of these numbers will appear in the set of 6 numbers for the round.

Small numbers will be randomly selected from a set of 20 numbers. This set includes 2 of each of the integers from 1 to 10.

The target number is generated randomly after the set of 6 numbers has been selected, and can be any integer between 100 and 999 (inclusive).

#### Gameplay

Once setup is complete, players are given 30 seconds to use the 4 basic mathematical operations on some or all of the given numbers to get as close as possible to the target number. Players should write their calculations down on paper.

Numbers may only be used once for each time they appear in the set of 6.

Use of fractions is not permitted at any stage in the calculation.

When the 30 seconds are up, each player must state the number closest to the target number that they have a series of calculations to get to, using the set of 6 numbers.

The player with the closest solution submits their calculations for approval, to ensure that numbers have not been used more than once and that the arithmetic is correct.

If multiple players tie for the closest solution, both solutions must be presented to ensure validity.

If a player presents the same solution as a previous player, they must prove that they did not copy the previous player by presenting their paper, where the solution had been written down during the allotted 30 seconds.

#### Scoring

Only the player with the solution closest to the target number scores points.

If there is a tie for the closest number among multiple players (including when multiple players have reached the target number itself), they all score points.

- **10 points** are awarded for a calculation resulting in the target number exactly.
- **7 points** are awarded for a non-exact calculation resulting in a number within 5 of the target number.
- **5 points** are awarded for a non-exact calculation resulting in a number between 6 and 10 of the target number.
- No points are awarded for calculations resulting in numbers more than 10 away from the target number.

For example:

Number set: `50`, `8`, `8`, `4`, `3`, `1`

Target number: `429`

- The exact solution below scores 10 points.
> 50 * 8 + 8 * 3 + 4 + 1 = 429

- The exact solution below also scores 10 points.
> (50 + 4) * 8 - 3 = 429

- The non-exact solution below scores 7 points.
> 50 * (8 + 1) - 8 * 3 + 4 = 430

- The non-exact solution below scores 5 points.
> 50 * (8 + 1) - 8 - 4 - 3 = 435

### Countdown Conundrum

In the Countdown Conundrum, a 9-letter anagram is presented to the players. They are given 30 seconds to solve the anagram.

If a player thinks they have solved the anagram, they can buzz in to stop the clock and present their answer.

If a player gives an incorrect answer, the countdown continues, and remaining players can buzz in.

Players may only guess once. If there are no players left to guess before the 30 seconds are up, the game finishes.
