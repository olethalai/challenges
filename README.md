# challenges

A space for keeping all the programming challenges I've attempted. This repository has also been of use to gain some experience with the use of Git.

#### Command Line Interface for APNS

Create a command line interface to enable faster sending of push notifications with specific options enabled to iOS development apps, using [Houston](https://github.com/nomad/houston/).

This challenge serves as both educational and practical - as well as learning how to make a tool for the command line, it will also enable me to automate push notification testing at work.

## Completed challenges

#### Heavy Balls - Ruby

*You are given a set of eight balls. Each ball is exactly the same weight as the other, except for one, which is slightly heavier. You have one set of balancing scales. Determine, in the fewest number of weighings, which ball is heavier.*

*Then, solve for n balls where one ball is heavier.*

The first sizable script I wrote using Ruby. This helped me to get to grips with the language to aid in my use of it for Cucumber step definitions.

Were I to do this challenge again, I would add better error handling, as opposed to simply printing descriptions of problems to the console.
