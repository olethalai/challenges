# challenges

A space for keeping all the programming challenges I've attempted. This repository has also been of use to gain some experience with the use of Git.

## Active Challenges

#### Meta Noughts And Crosses

Create a playable game of Meta Noughts And Crosses. This would be a great app for iOS 7, with the new zoom-in/zoom-out style of navigation.

* Play a game of noughts and crosses by playing a game of noughts and crosses inside each grid square to gain possession of that square.

* The location of the move played in the last turn maps onto the location of the grid where the next move must be played.

* When the automatically selected grid is full, the player can choose to play wherever they like.

Bonus points for creating AI.

## Completed Challenges

#### Lighthouse Archiving Script - Ruby

Build a script which interacts with the Lighthouse API to download ticket information and any attachments from any given project, and store them in appropriate directories.

This script fulfils a practical purpose - when migrating to another bug tracking tool from Lighthouse, I found that there was not an easy way to download all the data for existing projects. In order to continue to be able to refer back to past tickets, this script can be run to download and store all ticket data before the Lighthouse account is closed.

#### Command Line Interface for APNS - Ruby

Create a command line interface to enable faster sending of push notifications with specific options enabled to iOS development apps, using [Houston](https://github.com/nomad/houston/).

This challenge served as both educational and practical - as well as learning how to make a tool for the command line and how to make a Ruby gem, it also enabled me to automate push notification testing at work.

#### Heavy Balls - Ruby

*You are given a set of eight balls. Each ball is exactly the same weight as the other, except for one, which is slightly heavier. You have one set of balancing scales. Determine, in the fewest number of weighings, which ball is heavier.*

*Then, solve for n balls where one ball is heavier.*

The first sizable script I wrote using Ruby. This helped me to get to grips with the language to aid in my use of it for Cucumber step definitions.

Were I to do this challenge again, I would add better error handling, as opposed to simply printing descriptions of problems to the console.
