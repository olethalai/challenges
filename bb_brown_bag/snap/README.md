# Snap

Make a simplified game of snap!

- A game consisting of 2 players.
- Each player takes it in turns to say a random number between 1 and 10.
- If the same number is called twice in a row, the player says 'Snap!' and wins the game. (simplified to reduce complexity)

Define a method called play_snap which outputs something like:

  Player A = 2
  Player B = 8
  Player A = 3
  Player B = 5
  Player A = 7
  Player B = 3
  Player A = 3
  Player A says ‘Snap’
  Player A wins!
